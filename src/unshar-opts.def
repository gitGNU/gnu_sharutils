	With this option, @command{unshar} isolates each different shell archive
	from the others which have been placed in the same file, unpacking each
	in turn, from the beginning of the file to the end.  Its proper
	operation relies on the fact that many shar files are terminated by a
	readily identifiable string.

	For example, noticing that most `.signatures' have a double hyphen
	("--") on a line right before them, one can then sometimes use
	@code{--split-at=--}.  The signature will then be skipped, along with
	the headers of the following message.
